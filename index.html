        Welcome, nanny! You are hired to take care of Connor the Corgi while his
        owner is gone. It is your job to look after him and make sure that he is
        healthy and happy until his owner picks him up. You'll receive $100 in
        return. Remember that your actions might have consequences, so make wise
        decisions during your time with Connor. Good luck!
