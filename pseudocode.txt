- We have dog class, owner class, and sitter class.
- The dog has a name (string), health, hunger, happiness, and energy properties (all are numbers out of 100).
He also has isSick (boolean), ranAway (boolean), poisoned (boolean), and destructive (boolean).
He has feed(), play(), sleep(), pet(), walk(), reward(), and treat(), checkstatus() functions.
- Owner class has an owedAmount(number), tipAmount (number), pickUp(), slap(), tip(), and sue() functions.
- Sitter class has a bankAccount (number), forgive(), sue(), chase(), and whistle() functions.
- We have a food array that contains healthy and unhealthy dog food.
- We have an event object, which contains four events (functions) that will be randomly called during the game.
- We have a startGame button and giveUp button (which restarts the game).
- We have a counter that counts down until the owner comes back.

Game flow:
1- Player clicks start button (event listener), a pop up appears, introducing the dog, how much you will get paid, and when is the owner returning.
2- You click "okay" and the counter starts counting down (event listener and set interval.)
3- The status bars are initially all set to 50. You have buttons to feed, play, sleep, pet, walk, and reward the dog (event listeners).
4- For each button you click, one, two, or more status bars will be affected (each function increases or decreases the status bar value).
5- During the session, four events will randomly occur (arrays and math random). You have different reactions to choose from to approach the situation (buttons and onclick ?? or event listeners ??).
6- Each event has a maximum of three reactions, but each reaction can also branch out to include more conditions and response options
(if-else conditions).
7- Feed function displays the array of food objects, each object affects the health, hunger, and happiness bar.
8- If both happiness and energy reaches 100 we can show a fun "zoomies" pop up.
9- All booleans in the dog object will be used in the random events.
10- owedAmount is set at the start, and it decreases depending on the dog's status when the time is out.
11- tipAmount increases also depending on the dog's status when the time is out or as an event outcome.
12- pickUp is called at the end to wrap up the game and display the last scene.
13- bankAccount can be used in events depending on which option the user chooses to do.
14- slap(), use(), and forgive() can be called at the end of the game depending on the context.
15- chase() and whistle() will be used in one of the events.
16- the give up button (event listener) will have a button that will call the slap function before clearing all variables.
17- checkstatus() will check status bars and alert the player to take action.
